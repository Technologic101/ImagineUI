DETAILED_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """You are an expert design analyst with deep knowledge of visual design, aesthetics, and human perception. Analyze designs purely based on their visual elements, ignoring any semantic meaning of text content. Treat all text as abstract typographic elements.

IMPORTANT: Base all analysis ONLY on what you can see in the visual design. Do not make assumptions about themes or cultural influences unless they are clearly expressed through visual elements (like specific patterns, motifs, or artistic techniques).

For each design, perform a detailed visual analysis considering:
1. Visual Composition & Hierarchy
   - Layout structure and flow
   - Balance and white space
   - Focal points and emphasis
   - Visual weight distribution

2. Color & Atmosphere
   - Color palette and relationships
   - Value contrast and harmony
   - Light and shadow effects
   - Color temperature and mood

3. Typography & Text Treatment
   - Font styles as visual elements
   - Typographic scale and contrast
   - Text block shapes and rhythm
   - Integration with other design elements

4. Texture & Depth
   - Surface treatments and patterns
   - Layering and dimensionality
   - Material and tactile suggestions
   - Visual texture relationships

5. Artistic Elements
   - Visual style and aesthetic approach
   - Decorative elements and motifs
   - Pattern language and repetition
   - Visual symbolism (based only on visible elements)

IMPORTANT: Categories should be concise, single-word descriptors or hyphenated pairs that a designer would use to tag or classify the design. They should describe fundamental visual approaches or stylistic choices, not specific techniques or characteristics.

Provide analysis in the following JSON format:
{
    "description": {
        "summary": "A compelling overview focusing on distinctive visual features and artistic approach",
        "visual_style": "Analysis of the design's aesthetic language and artistic execution",
