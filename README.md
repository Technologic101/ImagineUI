# AI Designer

## Problem and Audience

### Problem:

  I want a tool that can use verbal instructions to prototype and iterate on a design for a UI or document.

### Audience:

  This app is for designers and non-designers who want to create UIs or documents using natural language. Examples include:

  - Styling a resume using a standardized template
  - Brand designers who want to iterate through ideas
  - Writers who want to present content in a visually engaging way
  - Creators of presentations and educational materials
  - Small business owners creating marketing materials

  The app will be particularly useful for cross-disciplinary web development teams discussing design concepts with stakeholders, to provide visual reference and preliminary materials for designs.

  
## Solution

  An agentic RAG application will be able to consume a template of html data, and create creative style variations based on input and feedback discussed with the user.

### Tools

a: LLM
b: Embedding Model
c: Orchestration
d: Vector Database
e: Monitoring
f: Evaluation
g: User Interface
h: Serving & Inference (optional)

   - Raw CSS files from CSS Zen Garden
   - Categorized style variations
   - Responsive design patterns

3. **Screenshots & Visuals**
   - Multiple viewport sizes (lg, sm)
   - Key UI component screenshots

4. **Metadata & Annotations**
   - Natural language descriptions of styles
   - Design pattern classifications
   - Accessibility ratings

### Dataset Format
```json
{
  "id": "style_001",
  "html_template": "path/to/template.html",
  "css_style": "path/to/style.css",
  "screenshots": {
    "lg": "path/to/desktop.png",
    "sm": "path/to/mobile.png"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "description": "A minimalist business template with...",
    "category": ["business", "minimalist"],
    "accessibility_score": 98,
    "color_scheme": ["#ffffff", "#000000", "#4285f4"]
  }
}
```

### Data Collection Process
1. **Web Scraping**
   - Scrape CSS Zen Garden submissions
   - Collect associated screenshots
   - Extract design descriptions

2. **Manual Curation**
   - Review and categorize styles
   - Validate HTML/CSS combinations
   - Add detailed annotations

3. **Automated Processing**
   - Generate screenshots across viewports
   - Extract color schemes
   - Calculate accessibility scores

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Validate file integrity
   - Check completeness of metadata
   - Verify screenshot quality

### Usage Guidelines
- Dataset is available under MIT License
- Proper attribution required for CSS Zen Garden content
- Screenshots may be used for training and testing
- Metadata can be extended with additional annotations

## **Problem Worth Solving**  
Designing and styling web pages requires both creative and technical skills. Many developers and designers struggle with:  
- Translating verbal descriptions into CSS styling.  
- Rapidly prototyping and iterating on web layouts.  
- Learning from real-world design patterns without extensive manual effort.  

An **agentic CSS style creator** can bridge the gap by understanding style requests, generating layouts, and applying creative yet functional CSS designs.  

## **Potential LLM Solution**  
- **Multi-modal learning**: Utilize a dataset of CSS styles (from CSS Zen Garden) and their corresponding rendered outputs (screenshots).  
- **RAG-enhanced retrieval**: Combine existing UI pattern descriptions with CSS rules for better style understanding.  
- **Agentic workflow**: Allow the model to iteratively improve its design based on user feedback, tweaking layouts and styles dynamically.  
- **Dual input approach**: Users can either submit their own HTML or allow the agent to generate a basic layout.  

## **Target Audience**  
- **Frontend Developers** who need quick style prototypes.  
- **UI/UX Designers** looking to explore creative styles.  
- **No-Code/Low-Code Builders** who want AI-powered styling.  
- **Beginner Developers** learning CSS through interactive examples.  

## **Key Metrics**  
1. **Styling Accuracy** – How closely does the CSS match the user's description?  
2. **Creativity & Uniqueness** – Does it produce diverse and visually appealing results?  
3. **Functional Usability** – Are the generated styles accessible and responsive?  
4. **Iteration Success** – Does the model effectively refine the layout based on feedback?  
5. **RAGAS Scores** – To evaluate retrieval quality and grounding accuracy.  

## **Data Sources for RAG and Fine-Tuning**  
- **CSS Zen Garden Stylesheets** – To learn various aesthetic interpretations.  
- **Screenshots of Zen Garden pages** – For multi-modal association between styles and visuals.  
- **UI Pattern Dataset (with descriptions)** – To enhance textual understanding of design patterns.  
- **Generated CSS & User Feedback Loops** – To improve iteration quality.

         def parse(self, response):
             for design in response.css('.design-selection li'):
                 yield {
                     'title': design.css('a::text').get(),
                     'css_url': design.css('a::attr(href)').get(),
                     'designer': design.css('.designer::text').get()
