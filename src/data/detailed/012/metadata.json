    "summary": "A dark, tech-inspired interface featuring metallic textures and glowing yellow-gold accents against a charcoal background, structured with a modular panel layout and strong visual hierarchy.",
    "visual_style": "The design employs an industrial-futuristic aesthetic with metallic surfaces, riveted borders, and glowing elements that create a sense of technical sophistication and digital craftsmanship.",
    "emotional_impact": "The contrast between dark backgrounds and luminous yellow-gold elements creates a contemplative yet energetic atmosphere, evoking both technical precision and organic flow.",
    "compositional_elements": "Structured content panels with distinct header elements organize information, while fluid, abstract golden waves at the bottom and top provide organic counterpoints to the rigid layout."
