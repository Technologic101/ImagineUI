  "description": "This design features a clean and organized layout with a balanced use of warm tones, particularly orange, to highlight key sections. The use of varied typography creates a visual hierarchy, distinguishing headings, subheadings, and body text effectively. Minimalistic icons and a modern logo add a contemporary feel, while the structured sidebar for navigation enhances usability and accessibility.",
