  "description": "The CSS Zen Garden design features a visually striking layout with a bold, distressed red and grey color palette that enhances the text-heavy composition. The design effectively uses a grunge aesthetic with textured backgrounds, creating an old-school, tactile feel. The typography is bold and prominent, with clear headings and subheadings that guide the reader through the content. The side navigation menu and text blocks are well-organized, ensuring functionality alongside artistic expression.",
