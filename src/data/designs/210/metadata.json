    "summary": "An immersive underwater-themed web design featuring a deep blue gradient background with tropical fish imagery and a structured content layout. The design creates a virtual marine environment through photographic elements and strategic color usage.",
    "visual_style": "The design employs a literal ocean aesthetic with photorealistic underwater imagery framing a centralized content area. Deep blue backgrounds transition to lighter azure at the surface, creating depth and environmental context.",
    "emotional_impact": "The aquatic imagery and cool blue color palette evoke a sense of calm exploration and depth, creating an immersive environment that reinforces the oceanic theme.",
    "compositional_elements": "The layout combines natural elements (fish photography, water texture) with structured content blocks. A central white-text-on-blue column creates a reading path surrounded by decorative marine life elements."
