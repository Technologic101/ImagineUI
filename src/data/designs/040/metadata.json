    "summary": "A dark, atmospheric web design with a monochromatic background juxtaposed against structured content panels. The design uses an asymmetrical layout with strong typographic contrast and selective yellow highlighting for navigation elements.",
    "visual_style": "The design employs a minimalist, industrial aesthetic with a dark monochromatic base. Abstract background textures create depth while rectangular content panels provide structural organization.",
    "emotional_impact": "Creates a contemplative, intellectual atmosphere through its high-contrast dark palette and deliberate spacing. The selective use of bright yellow against dark backgrounds creates tension and draws attention.",
    "compositional_elements": "Organized in a vertical flow with a distinctive header area featuring angled typography. Left-aligned navigation panels contrast with centered content boxes, creating a deliberate asymmetrical balance."
