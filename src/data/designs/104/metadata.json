  "description": "The CSS Zen Garden design emphasizes a harmonious blend of minimalism and elegance, using a subtle color palette of earthy tones to convey tranquility. The typography is refined, with classic serif fonts that enhance readability and lend a formal tone. The layout is clean and well-structured, with ample white space providing visual relief and guiding viewers through the content logically. The use of horizontal lines as separators adds structure without clutter, and the background floral motif adds a delicate, organic touch.",
