  "description": "This design employs a vintage newspaper aesthetic with a classic serif typography that evokes an old-world charm, utilizing sepia-toned paper backgrounds to enhance its nostalgic feel. The layout is text-heavy with a deliberate obfuscation, reflecting a layered collage effect. Its balanced placement keeps the focus central, inviting closer inspection and interaction.",
